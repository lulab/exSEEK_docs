# jupyter_utilities

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is a powerful tool to interactively use python to explore data. exSEEK use jupyter notebook to automatically generate publication level plots. 

Since there are many modules in exSEEK (and in corresponding jupyter). The plots scripts may seem confusing at first. We use many functions and tools to make the plot perfect. 

We have try to make it as simple as possible but you may still spend some time to learn how to use it (and it is worthwhile). Here we prepared a training notebook for you to gain more knowledge of plotting scripts.
