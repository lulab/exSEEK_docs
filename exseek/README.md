# exSEEK

In exSEEK module (our main module), we provide tools for long/small exRNA-seq expression matrix processing (filtering, normalization and batch removal) and feature selection. We also provide a tool to evaluate known biomarkers performance.

We have written instructions for matrix processing and feature selection. Another two instructions are examples of main program configuration and cluster configuration. **For all users using every module, it is a must to first fill in config file correcly.**
